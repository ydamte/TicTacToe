Description: This app is an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays with the machine.
There is a home screen that allows the user to choose who goes first (the user or the machine).
The app is programmed so that the machine never loses, in other words the machine either wins or ties with the user.
It makes a toast showing the winner and allows the user to play again, returning to the home screen.
